# Bootstrapping_snippet
This is a simple code snippet to demonstrate bootstrap sampling method to obtain C.I for median of a population given a small sample.
Dataset : 1 sample of size 10 of heights (in cm)
Objective: Obtain Confidence Interval of population median from given sample using bootstrap method
note: this is part of a code walkthrough of Applied AI Course.


Distribution of heights is unknown(population)
Random sample of size 10 is given (sample)
Objective is to calculate C.I for median of population given only a sample
